Suggested Learning Path for Lem-in Project:

Graph Traversals (BFS & DFS):
Make sure you understand BFS and DFS well, as they form the basis for most graph algorithms.

Graph Representation:
Learn how to represent your graph efficiently using an adjacency list or adjacency matrix (adjacency list is most commonly used for Lem-in).

Shortest Path Algorithms:
Understand Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford algorithms in detail for handling shortest paths.

Multiple Pathfinding and Flow Networks:
Study Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, and Maximum Flow concepts. These will be crucial for handling multiple ants and ensuring efficient movement in the graph.

Cycle Detection:
Learn how to use DFS for detecting cycles and ensuring that your paths do not lead to infinite loops.

Path Splitting & Simulation:
Once you’ve found paths, you’ll need to simulate ants moving through them. Consider how you’ll handle multiple ants (perhaps using a queue or prioritization mechanism).

Practice:
Try solving Lem-in-related problems on coding platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, or HackerRank to sharpen your skills. Focus on problems involving maximum flow, shortest path, and graph traversal.
